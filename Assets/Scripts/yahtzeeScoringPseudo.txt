scorecard component
dictionary of scoreName -> scoreEntry

scoreEntry:
	int score
	bool filled
// could just have score = -1 by default, no need for boolean. or private int score, public bool isFilled { get {return score > -1}}

for each scoreType in dictionary, scoreEntry.CalculatePotential


Calculating all possible scores with current roll of dice:
Sum all 1's, 2's, ... , 6's; store into int[6] faceSums;
THESE GIVE ALL POTENTIAL SCORES FOR UPPER HALF
CHeck if bonus eligible. If so: add 35 points.

Sum value of all dice; store into int totalSum;
Find number of all 1's, 2's, ... , 6's; store into int[6] faceQuantities;
Quantity determines score eligibility for all but chance.
	If faceQuantities[x] >= 3: 3-of-a-kind eligible, potentialScore = totalSum;
	If faceQuantities[x] >= 4: 4-of-a-kind eligible, potentialScore = totalSum;
	If faceQuantities[x] == 5; Yahtzee eligible, potentialScore = 50; Have to incorporate the yahtzee bonus as well, shouldn't be hard: bonusCount = 0; increment if yahtzee scored
																after 1st. Player scores a different entry for that turn.
																Add 50 per yahtzee bonus.
	If faceQuantities[x:x+3] > 0: small straight eligibile, potentialScore = 30;
	If faceQuantities[x:x+4] > 0: large straight eligible, potentialScore = 40;
	If faceQuantities[x] == 3 && faceQuantities[y] == 2: full house eligible, potentialScore = 25;
	Chance always eligible, potentialScore = totalSum;
